Solving a weird social problem with software.

For the longest time I set up my camera to name pictures based on the highest number on the SD Card. This meant that I have lots of folders with images named the same. So I can't easily merge them.

This tool fixes this. Give it a path tree and it will rename the files (according to a pattern) with an increasing integer counter.
